# restaurant_alpha
This is a side project for a restaurant site mocked up using a few of my favorite sushi restaurants in Jersey/NYC.

Visitors should be able to find the restaurant, read reviews posted from the Zomato API, and add menu items to an order.

I have no affiliations with Ani Ramen, KazuNori, or Sushi Yasuda.  This project started out as a restaurant site, then turned into e-commerce for practice.
